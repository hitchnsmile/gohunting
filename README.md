## Overview
A simple API wrapper for [Email Hunter](https://emailhunter.co), in Golang.

## License
gohunting is licensed under an MIT License. Due diligence: this is my first public Golang package, and because I wanted it to be up to community standards I modelled it after Sam Freiberg's [gotwillio](https://github.com/sfreiberg/gotwilio), which at the time of writing had a [rating of A by Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/sfreiberg/gotwilio).

## Installation
`go get github.com/dylanjt/gohunting`
